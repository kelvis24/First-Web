                propelling movie dashes off by taking us through the life of lead character Mr. Tony Lip who, till recently, was barely making a living out his regular routine. He had just lost his job and had now turned to gamble in order to put food
                on the table. He was stuck on how heâ€™d provide for his loving wife, Ms. Linda Cardellini, and his children, especially with Christmas steadily approaching by. All hope seemed squandered, and little did Tony Lip know that his profound vogue
                would lead him to an opportunity of a lifetime, just when he needed it the most.
