                This propelling movie dashes off by taking us through the life of lead character Mr. Tony Lip who, till recently, was barely making a living out his regular routine. He had just lost his job and had now turned to gamble in order to put food on the table.
                He was stuck on how he’d provide for his loving wife, Ms. Linda Cardellini, and his children, especially with Christmas steadily approaching by. All hope seemed squandered, and little did Tony Lip know that his profound vogue would lead
                him to an opportunity of a lifetime, just when he needed it the most.

            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">At first, he didn’t feel so lucky. The job proposal that he received was way far from being an average driver job. Mr. Don Shirley, Tony’s new acquaintance, needed more than a driver. “I am not just hiring a chauffeur. I need someone who can
                handle my artillery, be a personal assistant. I need a valet, someone to launder my clothes, shine my shoes.” (Shirley, 2018). And like expected, Tony’s response was “good luck Doc.”(Tony, 2018). It was until Dr. Shirley hiked the prices
                once more that Tony agreed to embark on this speculative journey far down south.</p>


            <p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 100px; font-size: 20px;  font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3f8b428/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/840x473!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2F8a%2F802eeb2b71f9bff6e7d54fa985f6%2Fla-1542067594-g2lceqe2xj-snap-image"
                    alt="Tony and Don Green Book" style="float: left; height: 300px;  width: 600px; margin-right:15px; margin-left:100px;"> The reason behind Tony’s rejection of the first offer, I guess, will never know. Tony was surely a racist, at least
                at the start of the movie. Was it the change in price that led to a change of heart? Was it his wife’s permission that caused this, or was it Dr. Shirley’s valiantness? I’ll leave that to you to decide, but anyway, their crusade that happens
                to be the basis of the entire movie was filled with a load full of ups and downs. We get a taste of why Shirley needed Tony so severely. Tony wasn’t just a white Italian American with a difficult name to pronounce. Not only was he good
                at persuasion but also slapping the crap out of idiots as you’ll eventually see.

            <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 200px; margin-top: 15px; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> The south was no place for a black man in the year 1962 as they’d rarely go through a day without Dr. Shirley being either insulted, attacked, degraded or even arrested. It seemed like no matter how high Dr. Shirley had climbed in life, his
                color was always in the way of him being treated as a normal human being, and the reason he kept going despite that all, always puzzled Tony. ”I live in a castle alone. Rich white people make me play piano for them cause it makes them
                fill cultured, but as soon as I leave that stage, I go back to being just another nigga to them. And I live alone because am not accepted by my own people because am not like them either. So if I am not black enough? And if I am not white
                enough. And if am not man enough, then tell me, Tony, what am I?”(Shirley, 2018.) <br>Don’t get me wrong; Tony was no saint other. He had a lot to learn from Dr. Shirley ranging from music, literature, and even culture. Their struggles
                only brought them closer, despite all the term oil they had faced. This would let them remain friends for life even though they’d finished the tour and made it back for Christmas together as promised.
