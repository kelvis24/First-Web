            <p class="normalP"> In my opinion, this movie powerfully depicts the social clash between the two different worlds of Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Lip as they embark on a dangerous quest deep down south. They shared a remarkable chemistry from the second they met.
                Throughout the entirety of the course, their bond would only bring them closer, especially as a result of the catastrophes that they experienced together. I can say for sure that as events unfolded, it turned out that Don Shirley needed
                Tony Lip as much as Tony Lip needed Don Shirley. The filled the gap in each others’ lives so well. Tony Lip always proved useful in saving Dr. Shirley regardless of the magnitude of the situation. Be if from the police, muggers, restaurant
                managers, and sometimes even saving Shirley from himself. Dr. Shirley, on the other hand, helped teach Tony the discipline of maintaining dignity, being patient, being well dressed, and even taught Tony how to write a letter to his wife
                with a little bit of Shakespeare flare to it. Not only that, but this movie also offers one a chance to reflect on the social challenges and injustices we face in life today. One is challenged by being driven through unique episodes that
                are based on a true story. Only through knowing and accepting what happened in the past, can one draw an accurate presentation of reality and see precisely what challenges we face in our communities today and understand what the future
                holds. Green book is more than just about a social clash. It’s a bold and magnificent crusade. It’s a harbinger that forecasts what achievements man could accomplish together if all differences were compromised and much focused were placed
                on the goal instead of the former. Ladies and gentlemen, Green Book, is a feast for the eyes that I do more than recommend you to watch.
