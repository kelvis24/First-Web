                    1962, a working-class Italian-American bouncer from the Bronx (Viggo Mortensen) becomes chauffeur to a world-renowned pianist (Mahershala Ali), who happens to be black and gay. They embark on a tour of Middle America, then the Deep
                    South; both men learn a thing or two about prejudice (including their own) and surprise themselves by becoming best friends. Peter Farrelly directed this upbeat docudrama, and like the comedies he made with his brother Bobby (Kingpin,
                    There’s Something About Mary, et al), it’s overstated, emotionally manipulative, and disarmingly bighearted. The film hits every dramatic point you’d expect it to make: the pianist teaches the driver about culture, the driver teaches
                    the pianist to loosen up, both characters get to tell off southern bigots, etc. Yet Farrelly and his cast deliver the cliches with such sincerity and good cheer that the film won me over anyway.

                    To pick up some side money, a raffish Copacabana bouncer agrees to chauffeur and an African-American jazz musician on a concert tour through the deep South. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali’s deeply engaging performances are the
                    best Christmas present moviegoers will open this year. It’s when the two finally find themselves on even footing that the picture goes beyond a standard lecture on the evils of racism. Directed by one half of the Farrelly Brothers,
                    Green Book isn’t content to simply smell like a Driving Miss Daisy. Surprisingly, the messages are not imparted with a wagging finger, but smuggled in as a shared experience. Is it a feel-good charmer poised to rake in greenbacks and
                    Oscar gold? You bet! But don’t let that keep you away from this overall well balanced (and timed) look forward from the safe distance of America’s motley past. (2018) — Scott Marks

                    between black jazz musician Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and the racist driver (Viggo Mortensen) hired to take him through the South on a concert tour in the early 1960s. “The whole story is about loving each other despite our differences,”
                    said director Peter Farrelly, who also won best original screenplay, one of three awards Green Book won on the evening.
